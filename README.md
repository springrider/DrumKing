# DrumKing

drum scoring game for my kid,  and for yours too.

the scoring system came with the electric drum sucks and hard to use. so I made this game, with QUICK and DIRTY code and the arts "borrowed" from "Taiko no Tatsujin". 

the game plays 4/4 beat with customizable BPM for 1 minute while reading input from the drum, then calculate a score.

you can simulate the drum input by pressing:
"i" for start game;
"a" for the beat;
